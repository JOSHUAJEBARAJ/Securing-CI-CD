Software Bill of material is list of components(third party) present in the Code 

To generate the **SBOM** I am going to use [cyclonedx](https://cyclonedx.org/)

I am going to use [CycloneDX Python Module](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python) to generate the SBOM since the application is based on the python
